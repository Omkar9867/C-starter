--> ldd cmd tool
// ldd is a tool that will show what libraries are needed by the dynamic linker. It will also show the location of the libs on the system.
// Generally, it is used as a debugging tool used to see what share objects(.so) files are missing when building software.


--> gcc invokes the entire build process, which involves preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking the code. The linker is the last step in the build process.
// It takes the object files generated by the compiler and links them together to create an executable file.
// The linker also resolves any external references to functions or variables that are defined in other object files or libraries.
// The linker can also include shared libraries, which are dynamically linked at runtime, rather than statically linked at compile time.

The physical structure of the project is important
One of the factors is how to organize our source code.
Other is how we 'include' files.
```
```
└── 📁library
    └── 📁include
        └── math.h
    └── 📁src
        └── main.c
        └── math.c
```
```

=====================
--> To compile the file we need to gcc (./src/*.c) all the c files and include (-I ./include) the include folder
-I tells compliler where to find the header files for the project the .h files

--> Now to buid the files to make it use as a library
```
gcc -c ./src/math.c -I./include
```
Similarly for main.c which will provide you (.o) file for that respective name
Once this object files (.o) are ready we donot need to -I./include again.
Note: to build the main.c again if changes added.

==================================Static-Lib==============
--> Object file
(.o) are compiled code file. They contain symbol (names of variables and functions) of the compiled code.
There are several type of object files: static, shared . executable

--> Archive
(ar) tool builds an index of multiple files that can package together
This allows to distribute a static library that may consist of multiple .o files packaged together.
``` ar rcs my-file.a file.o file2.o ```
r - does inssertion into the Archive
c- Creates Archive
s- Adds an index into the archive


===================================Dynamci-Lib===========
--> Share object file :
.so     -linux
.dll    -windows
.dylib  -mac
